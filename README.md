This is repository of my series about "Ansible For AWS: Not All Just About IaC! Series' Articles"

Since I made any update based on use cases of each blog post, please read and follow the instructions carefully and don't execute it all together. All implementation about change or use of tags and variables are executed separately.

I put all tasks in single yaml file but here I created different files for each category. It's all up to you for how you will manage these, either in single file or multiple files.

If you have any questions, please comment on https://dev.to/nurulramadhona blog post.
